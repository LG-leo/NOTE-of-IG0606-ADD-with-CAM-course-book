# U5 – Logarithmic and Exponential Functions[not classify with course book]

## 5.1 Definitions & Basic Properties

### Logarithms

For \(a > 0,\ a \neq 1\) and \(x > 0\):
\[
y = \log_a x \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad a^y = x
\]

- \(\log_a x\) is the **power** you raise \(a\) to get \(x\).  
- In IGCSE 0606, \(\log_{10}x\) is often written as \(\lg x\).  
- Natural logarithm: \(\ln x = \log_e x\), where \(e \approx 2.718\).

**Common values**:  
\(\lg 10 = 1,\quad \lg 100 = 2,\quad \ln e = 1,\quad \ln 1 = 0\)

---

### Exponential Functions

For \(a > 0,\ a \neq 1\):
\[
y = a^x
\]

---

## 5.2 Laws of Logarithms

| Rule (in symbols) | Example |
|------------------|---------|
| \(\log_a (MN) = \log_a M + \log_a N\) | \(\lg(2\times5) = \lg2 + \lg5\) |
| \(\log_a \frac{M}{N} = \log_a M - \log_a N\) | \(\lg\frac{100}{10} = \lg100 - \lg10 = 2 - 1 = 1\) |
| \(\log_a (M^k) = k \log_a M\) | \(\lg(10^3) = 3\lg10 = 3\) |
| \(\log_a a = 1\) | \(\lg10 = 1\) |
| \(\log_a 1 = 0\) | \(\lg1 = 0\) |

> **Note**: These rules work for any base \(a\) (\(a>0,\ a\neq1\)).  
> “Addition” outside the log becomes multiplication inside; “subtraction” becomes division; multiplication outside becomes power inside.

---

## 5.3 Graphs – Exponential vs Logarithmic

### Exponential \(y = a^x\)

| \(a > 1\) | \(0 < a < 1\) |
|----------|--------------|
| Passes through \((0,1)\) | Passes through \((0,1)\) |
| Increasing | Decreasing |
| \(x\)-axis (\(y=0\)) is a **horizontal asymptote** | \(x\)-axis (\(y=0\)) is a **horizontal asymptote** |
| As \(x \to -\infty,\ y \to 0^+\) | As \(x \to +\infty,\ y \to 0^+\) |
| As \(x \to +\infty,\ y \to +\infty\) | As \(x \to -\infty,\ y \to +\infty\) |

### Logarithmic \(y = \log_a x\)

| \(a > 1\) | \(0 < a < 1\) |
|----------|--------------|
| Passes through \((1,0)\) | Passes through \((1,0)\) |
| Increasing | Decreasing |
| \(y\)-axis (\(x=0\)) is a **vertical asymptote** | \(y\)-axis (\(x=0\)) is a **vertical asymptote** |
| As \(x \to 0^+,\ y \to -\infty\) | As \(x \to 0^+,\ y \to +\infty\) |
| As \(x \to +\infty,\ y \to +\infty\) | As \(x \to +\infty,\ y \to -\infty\) |

**Key symmetry**:  
\(y = \log_a x\) and \(y = a^x\) are **inverse functions**. Their graphs are reflections of each other in the line \(y = x\).

---

## 5.4 Domain and Range

| Function | Domain | Range |
|----------|--------|-------|
| \(y = a^x\) (\(a>0,\ a\neq1\)) | \(\mathbb{R}\) (all real numbers) | \(y > 0\) |
| \(y = \log_a x\) (\(a>0,\ a\neq1\)) | \(x > 0\) | \(\mathbb{R}\) |

**Important for composite functions**:
- For \(y = \ln(ax+b)\): **inside must be positive**, i.e. \(ax+b > 0\).  
- Example: \(f(x) = \ln(3-x)\) has domain \(3-x > 0 \Rightarrow x < 3\).

---

## 5.5 Solving Equations with Logs and Exponentials

### 5.5.1 Exponential Equations

**Method**: Take logs of both sides (usually \(\lg\) or \(\ln\)), then use the power rule.

**Example**: Solve \(5^x = 65\).

\[
\begin{aligned}
5^x &= 65 \\
\lg(5^x) &= \lg 65 \\
x \lg 5 &= \lg 65 \\
x &= \frac{\lg 65}{\lg 5} \approx 2.593
\end{aligned}
\]

### 5.5.2 Logarithmic Equations

**Method**: Combine logs using the laws, then convert to exponential form. **Always check the domain** (arguments of logs must be positive).

**Example**: Solve \(2\lg(4+x) = \lg(8+2x)\).

\[
\begin{aligned}
\lg(4+x)^2 &= \lg(8+2x) \\
(4+x)^2 &= 8+2x \\
x^2 + 8x + 16 &= 8 + 2x \\
x^2 + 6x + 8 &= 0 \\
(x+2)(x+4) &= 0 \\
x &= -2 \quad\text{or}\quad x = -4
\end{aligned}
\]

**Check domain**:  
\(4+x > 0 \Rightarrow x > -4\)  
\(8+2x > 0 \Rightarrow x > -4\)  

- \(x = -2\) is valid (\(-2 > -4\)) ✅  
- \(x = -4\) is **not** valid (\(4+(-4)=0\), log undefined) ❌  

**Solution**: \(x = -2\).

---

## 5.6 Change of Base Formula

\[
\log_a b = \frac{\log_c b}{\log_c a} \qquad (c > 0,\ c \neq 1)
\]

Commonly we use \(c = 10\) or \(c = e\):

\[
\log_a b = \frac{\lg b}{\lg a} \quad\text{or}\quad \log_a b = \frac{\ln b}{\ln a}
\]

**Special case**: \(\log_a b = \dfrac{1}{\log_b a}\) (when the two bases are swapped).

---

## 5.7 Transformations (Shifts)

### Exponential: \(y = a^{x} + c\)  
- Horizontal asymptote moves from \(y=0\) to \(y=c\).  
- Example: \(y = 2^x + 3\) has asymptote \(y=3\).

### Logarithmic: \(y = \log_a (x - h)\)  
- Vertical asymptote moves from \(x=0\) to \(x=h\).  
- Example: \(y = \ln(x-2)\) has asymptote \(x=2\).

---

## 5.8 A Typical “Mixed” Log Equation (from past papers)

**Problem**: Solve \(\displaystyle \frac{\ln(2x+3)}{\ln 5} = 2\).

**Solution**:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\ln(2x+3)}{\ln 5} &= 2 \\
\ln(2x+3) &= 2\ln 5 \\
\ln(2x+3) &= \ln(5^2) \\
2x+3 &= 25 \\
2x &= 22 \\
x &= 11
\end{aligned}
\]

**Check domain**: \(2x+3 > 0 \Rightarrow 11 > -1.5\) ✅.

---

## 5.9 Inverse Functions

For \(y = a^x\): swap \(x\) and \(y\) → \(x = a^y\) → \(y = \log_a x\).  
So \(f(x) = a^x\) and \(f^{-1}(x) = \log_a x\) are inverses.

**Example**: Find the inverse of \(f(x) = e^{2x}\).

\[
\begin{aligned}
y &= e^{2x} \\
x &= e^{2y} \quad\text{(swap)}\\
\ln x &= 2y \\
y &= \frac{1}{2}\ln x
\end{aligned}
\]
Thus \(f^{-1}(x) = \frac12 \ln x\).

---

## 5.10 Summary – Key Points to Remember

- \(\log_a x\) is defined only for \(x>0\).  
- \(\log_a 1 = 0\), \(\log_a a = 1\).  
- Laws: \(\log(MN)=\log M+\log N\), \(\log(M/N)=\log M-\log N\), \(\log(M^k)=k\log M\).  
- Exponential \(y=a^x\) has horizontal asymptote \(y=0\); logarithmic \(y=\log_a x\) has vertical asymptote \(x=0\).  
- Transformations shift asymptotes: \(y=a^x+c\) shifts asymptote to \(y=c\); \(y=\log_a(x-h)\) shifts asymptote to \(x=h\).  
- When solving logarithmic equations, **always check domain** (arguments > 0).

# IGCSE 0606 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions (Chapter 5) – Problem-Solving Guide (Revised Edition)
-我真的服了，教辅书的编辑真的不知道真题考啥，怎么考吗？真的不知道这些东西怎么做才是对的吗，这个章节怎么只教释义啊！
---

## Step 1: Exponential Equations

**Core Goal**: Either make the bases the same, or take logarithms to bring the exponent down.

### 1. Same Base Method

- **When to use**: Both sides can be written as powers of the same number (e.g., 2, 3, e, 10).
- **Method**: If \(a^m = a^n\) (with \(a > 0\) and \(a \neq 1\)), then \(m = n\).
- **Tip**: When you see numbers like 2, 4, 8 or 3, 9, 27, rewrite them as powers of the same base (e.g., \(8 = 2^3\), \(27 = 3^3\)).
- **Example**: \(2^{x+1} = 8\) → \(2^{x+1} = 2^3\) → \(x+1 = 3\) → \(x = 2\).

### 2. Taking Logarithms Method

- **When to use**: Bases cannot be made the same (e.g., \(2^x = 5\), \(e^{2x} = 10\)).
- **Method**: Take \(\ln\) (natural log) or \(\lg\) (common log) of both sides. Then use the power rule: \(\ln(a^b) = b \ln a\).
- **Tip**: If the equation contains \(e\) (the natural exponential), use \(\ln\) because \(\ln e = 1\) simplifies the working.
- **Important**: You must take logs of **both sides** together. You cannot take logs of only one side.
  - ✅ Correct: \(2^x = 5\) → \(\lg(2^x) = \lg 5\) → \(x \lg 2 = \lg 5\) → \(x = \frac{\lg 5}{\lg 2}\)
  - ❌ Wrong: \(2^x = 5\) → \(x = \lg 5\) (this loses the factor \(\lg 2\))

---

## Step 2: Logarithmic Equations

**Core Goal**: Use logarithm laws to combine or split terms. **Always check the domain** – the argument of every logarithm must be positive.

### 1. Change of Base

- **Formula**: \(\displaystyle \log_a b = \frac{\log_c b}{\log_c a}\) (usually choose \(c = 10\) or \(c = e\)).
- **Useful form**: \(\displaystyle \log_a b = \frac{1}{\log_b a}\).
- **Example**: Simplify \(\log_5 10\) → \(\frac{\lg 10}{\lg 5} = \frac{1}{\lg 5}\).

### 2. Laws of Logarithms

| Law | Formula | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| Addition | \(\log_a M + \log_a N = \log_a (MN)\) | \(\lg 2 + \lg 5 = \lg(2\times5) = \lg 10 = 1\) |
| Subtraction | \(\log_a M - \log_a N = \log_a \left(\frac{M}{N}\right)\) | \(\lg 100 - \lg 10 = \lg(100/10) = \lg 10 = 1\) |
| Power rule | \(\log_a (M^k) = k \log_a M\) | \(\lg(10^3) = 3\lg 10 = 3\) |

- **Exam focus**: Many questions ask you to simplify an expression into the form \(c + d\log y\). To do this, you split products and quotients using addition/subtraction rules, then use the power rule to move coefficients.

### 3. ⚠️ Critical Warning: Extraneous Solutions

- After solving a logarithmic equation, **substitute your solutions back into the original equation**.
- Any solution that makes any logarithm’s argument ≤ 0 must be rejected.
- **Example**: Solve \(\lg(x-1) + \lg(x+1) = 0\)  
  → \(\lg[(x-1)(x+1)] = 0\) → \((x-1)(x+1) = 1\) → \(x^2 - 1 = 1\) → \(x^2 = 2\) → \(x = \sqrt{2}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{2}\).
  - \(x = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.41\) → \(x-1 > 0\), \(x+1 > 0\) ✅
  - \(x = -\sqrt{2} \approx -1.41\) → \(x-1 < 0\) ❌ (argument of first log is negative) → reject.

---

## Step 3: Quadratic-Type Exponential/Logarithmic Equations

**Core Goal**: Use substitution to turn the equation into a quadratic.

### Substitution Method

- **When to use**: The equation contains a term and its square, e.g., \(5^x\) and \(5^{2x} = (5^x)^2\), or \(\ln x\) and \((\ln x)^2\).
- **Method**:
  1. Let \(y = 5^x\) (or \(y = \ln x\), etc.).
  2. The equation becomes a quadratic in \(y\): \(ay^2 + by + c = 0\).
  3. Solve for \(y\).
  4. **Replace \(y\) back**: solve \(5^x = y\) (or \(e^x = y\), etc.) for \(x\).
- **Important**: If \(y = 5^x\), then \(y\) must be **positive** (exponential functions only give positive outputs). If you get a negative \(y\), discard it.
- **Example**: \(3^{2x} - 4\cdot3^x + 3 = 0\)  
  Let \(y = 3^x\). Then \(y^2 - 4y + 3 = 0\) → \((y-1)(y-3)=0\) → \(y = 1\) or \(y = 3\).  
  - \(3^x = 1\) → \(x = 0\)  
  - \(3^x = 3\) → \(x = 1\)  
  Both solutions are valid (no negative \(y\)).

---

## Step 4: Simultaneous Exponential Equations

**Core Goal**: Reduce to a system of linear equations by expressing everything with the same prime base.

### Method: Prime Base Reduction

- **When to use**: Equations like \(8^q = 2^{p+1}\) and \(4^p = 2^{q}\).
- **Steps**:
  1. Write each number as a power of a prime (2, 3, 5, etc.).
  2. Use the power rule: \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\).
  3. Equate exponents to form linear equations.
  4. Solve the linear system.
- **Example**: \(8^q = 2^{p+1}\) and \(4^p = 2^{q}\).
  - \(8^q = (2^3)^q = 2^{3q}\) → so \(3q = p+1\)
  - \(4^p = (2^2)^p = 2^{2p}\) → so \(2p = q\)
  - Solve: \(q = 2p\) → substitute into \(3(2p) = p+1\) → \(6p = p+1\) → \(5p = 1\) → \(p = 0.2\), \(q = 0.4\).

---

## Step 5: Domain, Graphs and Transformations

**Core Goal**: Understand the restrictions on \(x\) and how shifting changes the graph.

### 1. Domain Restrictions for Logarithms

- For \(\log_b(f(x))\), we require \(f(x) > 0\).
- If there are multiple logarithms, **take the intersection** of all their domain conditions.
- **Example**: \(\ln(x-2) + \ln(5-x)\) requires \(x-2 > 0\) AND \(5-x > 0\) → \(x > 2\) and \(x < 5\) → domain \(2 < x < 5\).

### 2. Finding Intersections Graphically

- If you see a problem like \(a^x = kx + b\), it often asks for the number of solutions.
- Sketch \(y = a^x\) and \(y = kx + b\) (a line). Count their intersection points.
- For exact intersection (e.g., \(\log_a x = c\)), convert to exponential form: \(x = a^c\).

### 3. Transformations (Shifting Asymptotes)

- **Exponential**: \(y = a^x + c\)  
  - Horizontal asymptote moves from \(y = 0\) to \(y = c\).  
  - Example: \(y = 2^x + 3\) has asymptote \(y = 3\).
- **Logarithmic**: \(y = \ln(x - h)\)  
  - Vertical asymptote moves from \(x = 0\) to \(x = h\).  
  - Example: \(y = \ln(x-2)\) has asymptote \(x = 2\), domain \(x > 2\).

---

## Step 6: Solving Quadratic Forms (Again, but with Logs)

**Core Goal**: Recognize when a substitution turns a logarithmic equation into a quadratic.

### Factoring After Substitution

- **When to use**: The equation contains \(\ln(5x)\) and \((\ln(5x))^2\).
- **Method**: Let \(u = \ln(5x)\). Solve \(au^2 + bu + c = 0\) by factoring or the quadratic formula.
- **Important trap**: \(\ln(5x)\) is **not** equal to \(\ln 5 \cdot \ln x\). The power rule only applies when the **argument** is raised to a power, not when the whole logarithm is multiplied.

- **Example**: \(3(\ln 5x)^2 + 2\ln 5x - 1 = 0\)  
  Let \(u = \ln 5x\). Then \(3u^2 + 2u - 1 = 0\) → \((3u - 1)(u + 1) = 0\) → \(u = \frac{1}{3}\) or \(u = -1\).  
  - \(\ln 5x = \frac13\) → \(5x = e^{1/3}\) → \(x = \frac{1}{5}e^{1/3}\)  
  - \(\ln 5x = -1\) → \(5x = e^{-1}\) → \(x = \frac{1}{5e}\)

---

## Additional Topics

### Parameter Problems (Equations with Unknown Constants)

- **When to use**: The problem says “the equation has exactly one solution”, “no real solution”, etc.
- **Strategy**:
  - For equations like \(2^x = k - x\), think about the graphs: \(y = 2^x\) (exponential) and \(y = k - x\) (a straight line with slope -1). The number of solutions is the number of intersection points.
  - For quadratic forms after substitution, use the discriminant: \(\Delta = 0\) gives one solution, \(\Delta > 0\) gives two, etc., **but** remember to check domain restrictions on the substituted variable (e.g., \(y = 5^x > 0\)).

### Applications: Exponential Growth/Decay

- **Standard forms**:  
  - \(N = N_0 e^{kt}\) (continuous growth, e.g., bacteria, radioactive decay)  
  - \(N = N_0 a^t\) (discrete growth, e.g., compound interest)
- **How to solve**:
  1. Identify \(N_0\) (initial value) from the context.
  2. Use one data point to find the growth factor \(k\) or \(a\).
  3. Answer the question (find a value, find time, etc.).
- **Example**: A population starts at 100 and triples every 2 hours. Find a formula and the population after 5 hours.  
  - \(P = 100 \cdot 3^{t/2}\) (because after 2 hours, multiply by 3)  
  - After 5 hours: \(P = 100 \cdot 3^{2.5} = 100 \cdot 3^{5/2} = 100 \cdot 3^2 \cdot \sqrt{3} = 900\sqrt{3}\)
-# Supplement: Exponential/Logarithmic Equations with Parameters

**Core idea**: Number of solutions → convert to number of intersection points of graphs, or to root distribution of a quadratic equation.

────────────────────────────────
## Method 1: Graphical Method
────────────────────────────────

**When to use**: The two sides of the equation have very different forms (e.g., exponential vs. line, logarithmic vs. line).

**Steps**:
1. Write the equation as \( f(x) = g(x) \), with the parameter appearing in one of them.
2. Sketch the graph of the function without the parameter.
3. Sketch the graph of the line (or curve) that contains the parameter; observe how the number of intersection points changes as the parameter varies.
4. Find the **tangency** condition (critical case for a unique solution):
   - Let the point of tangency be \((x_0, y_0)\).
   - Slopes equal: \( f'(x_0) = g'(x_0) \).
   - Function values equal: \( f(x_0) = g(x_0) \).
5. Solve for the critical parameter value(s).
6. From the sketch, determine the parameter range that matches the required number of solutions.

**Example**: \( e^x = kx \) has exactly one solution. Find \( k \).

- Tangency condition: let the tangency point be \((t, e^t)\).
  \[
  e^t = k t \quad \text{and} \quad e^t = k \quad (\text{derivative of } e^x \text{ is } e^x)
  \]
  From \( e^t = k \) and \( e^t = k t \), we get \( k = k t \) → \( t = 1 \).
  Hence \( k = e^1 = e \).

- For \( k > e \): no intersection.
- For \( k = e \): one intersection (tangent).
- For \( 0 < k < e \): two intersections.

- **Answer**: \( k = e \).

────────────────────────────────
## Method 2: Discriminant Method (Substitution)
────────────────────────────────

**When to use**: The equation can be turned into a quadratic by a substitution, such as \( a^{2x} \) and \( a^x \), or \( (\log x)^2 \) and \( \log x \).

**Steps**:
1. Substitute: let \( t = a^x \) or \( t = \log x \). Note the domain of \( t \):
   - If \( t = a^x \) (\( a > 0, a \neq 1 \)), then \( t > 0 \).
   - If \( t = \log_a x \), then \( x = a^t \) (no extra restriction on \( t \) except that it is real).
2. Obtain a quadratic equation in \( t \): \( A t^2 + B t + C = 0 \).
3. Translate the condition on the original equation (“has solution”, “has unique solution”, etc.) into conditions on the roots of this quadratic.
4. Use:
   - Discriminant \( \Delta = B^2 - 4AC \):
     - \( \Delta \ge 0 \) (real roots)
     - \( \Delta = 0 \) (double root)
     - \( \Delta < 0 \) (no real root)
   - Vieta’s formulas: sum of roots \( = -B/A \), product \( = C/A \).
   - Additional restrictions on the roots (e.g., positive, negative, within an interval).
5. Solve for the parameter range.

**Example**: \( 4^x - k \cdot 2^x + 1 = 0 \) has a solution. Find \( k \).

- Let \( t = 2^x > 0 \). The equation becomes \( t^2 - k t + 1 = 0 \).
- For a solution in \( x \), we need a real \( t > 0 \) that satisfies the quadratic.
- Discriminant: \( \Delta = k^2 - 4 \ge 0 \) → \( k \ge 2 \) or \( k \le -2 \).
- Product of roots = \( 1 > 0 \) → roots have the same sign.
- Sum of roots = \( k > 0 \) → for positive roots we need \( k > 0 \).
- Combine: \( k \ge 2 \).
- **Answer**: \( k \ge 2 \).

────────────────────────────────
**Note**: Always verify boundary cases (endpoints, domain restrictions) after solving.

## Exam Checklist

Before you start, ask yourself:

1. **Bases**: Are the bases the same? If yes, equate exponents. If not, take logs.
2. **Structure**: Do you see \(a^x\) and \(a^{2x}\)? Use substitution to form a quadratic.
3. **Operations**: Are you adding/subtracting logs? Combine them into a single log.
4. **Domain**: If it’s a logarithmic equation, **always check** that solutions make all arguments positive.
5. **Coefficients**: In simultaneous equations, write everything with prime bases, then compare exponents.
6. **Graphs**: If the question asks for number of solutions or parameter ranges, sketch the two graphs.
7. **Applications**: For growth/decay, identify the initial value and use one data point to find the growth constant.

## One‑Line Summary

> **Exponentials take logs, logarithms need domain checks, change of base simplifies, graphs focus on asymptotes, substitution solves quadratics, and simultaneous equations reduce to prime bases.**
